## Audit Summary
   -  To summarize the election analysis using the PyPoll script we were able to achieve a detailed analysis from the election_results.csv file. 
    We determined all participants, total votes and final results of those votes. This script can be applied to many types of scenarios that undertake 
	a poll, based off of a voting style system. If you wanted slightly different results you could modify the script to display in descending order from most to the least amount
	of votes. Or you can add more data to the election results to display an election for the entire state of Colorado.
